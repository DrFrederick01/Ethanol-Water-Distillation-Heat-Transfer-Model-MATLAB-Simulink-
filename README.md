# ðŸ”¥ Ethanol-Water Distillation Heat Transfer Model

This MATLAB-based project models the heat and mass transfer during the distillation of an ethanol-water mixture. It simulates how liquid and vapour concentrations change over time and evaluates the effectiveness of the distillation process. The model is built to simulate and validate theoretical predictions in a lab environment, using data collected from experimental runs.

## Objective

To simulate and analyse the heat transfer and mass separation in a distillation column, allowing for comparison between theoretical and real-world results. The goal was to:

- Model the **mass transfer** of ethanol and water vapour  
- Simulate **temperature profiles**, **vaporisation rates**, and **liquid levels**  
- Analyse the **heat transfer process**  
- Compare model outputs with experimental data  

---

## Tech Stack

- **MATLAB**  
- Experimental apparatus (Lab-scale distillation unit)  

---

## Key Concepts

- Energy balance equations for heating and vaporisation  
- Mass transfer of multicomponent mixtures (ethanol + water)  
- Modelling real-time dynamic systems  
- Interpreting lab data to validate simulations

## Experimental Setup

The setup consisted of a distillation column heated by a reboiler, with vapour condensing into a collection flask. Temperature sensors and measuring instruments were used to collect time-based data for comparison.

- **Boil-up mixture**: 250 mL (80% ethanol, 20% water)  
- **Equipment**: Reboiler, thermocouples, condenser, collection flasks  
- **Key Data Points**: Initial and final ethanol concentrations, distillate collected, heat applied, time elapsed

## Simulation Outputs

The model provides real-time visualisation of:

- **Temperature over time**  
- **Ethanol concentration drop**  
- **Distillate volume increase**  
- **Rate of mass loss**  

These outputs are compared with physical lab results.
